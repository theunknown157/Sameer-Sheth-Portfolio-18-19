	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">This year's game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDDGBcs0TFM" target="_blank">Turning Point</a> and as seen in the link, it consists of shooting balls at flags and flipping caps to score certain amount of points.  Although shooting a ball may seem easy, there are many steps to this process which make it extremely difficult.</font></p>
	
	<img src="https://theunknown157.weebly.com/uploads/6/2/1/3/62130455/intakebot_orig.png" alt="intake of the bot" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">In order to shoot the ball, you need to get the ball to the shooter.  For 750Z, we had 3 intake systems which were all on the bot at one point.  For our first competition at Sicklerville, we had one singular roller intake which I worked on.  This intake was extremely fast at first because we had geared it one to one and this led to the problem of fipping caps twice instead once causing us to score for the other team.  The second intake which was used at SBHS was another thing which I worked on for 750Z but due to the lack of parts, our team had to become more innovative.  We realized that if you space out the rollers very precisely, you can use gears to bring the ball up.  In addition to this, we used a metal mesh as a track for the ball to climb up to our shooter.  The metal mesh did not have enough friction for the ball to climb up all the way to the shooter, so we used a fabric mesh in order to bring the ball up to the shooter efficiently. A picture of the intake is to the left.</font></p><br><br><br><br>

	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">Another important part of a robot is the drive which it uses.  We used a normal 4-motor drive but again, this was one of the things which we had to change multiple times.  The first drive which we had was extremely fast and since we had omni wheels as our back wheels, we were also drifting a lot.  This caused many problems so we decided that our best bet was to gear 1 to 1 and we should also use correct spacing.  At one of the school meetings, we finished on of the sides of the drive but in order to not waste an entire meeting just fixing the drive, I took the bot home and finished the other side(with my team's permission) making sure to reflect the other side of the drive which was already finished.  I finished the other side of drive but then I realized that the holes were not matching up so I had to change the spacing of both the sides of the drive.  We later found out that this drive was slipping whenever the bot had the shooter on, it had to overcome a stronger static friction force due to its weight but we fixed this using chain and sprockets.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">When our team first formed, we were originally going to score most of our points using caps as most people were going to shoot flags.  Since we did not have much time leading up to the competition at Sicklerville, we decided that we would go make a descorer in order to help us flip caps as well as descore caps put on rods.  Me and another teammate built a descorer which could rotate 270 degrees and we learned later that the only way to rotate a full 360 degrees was to was to remove our gearing for torque.  However, at Sicklerville, the descorer had cons which outweighed the pros.  The biggest con was the fact that no one at Sicklerville even put caps on the rod so we never needed our descorer.  In addition, we could only use the descorer in the expansion zone and we got warnings for extending out of 18 by 18 vertically. The descorer also got stuck in the intake mutliple times and we decided to remove it after this competition.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">Other than the descorer, intake and drive, I was on the drive team(image on the right featuring me, Prabhav, and Pranav going in order from left to right) for 750Z and I helped stabilize our bot and I came to every competition except TCNJ.  While I was with 750S, I learned how to build and use ratchet gears and this taught me a lot about different ways of conserving energy and how to make sure the the smallest amount of energy can escape once it is put into the system.</font></p>

	<h2><font face="Impact" color="black">Community Outreach</font></h3>
	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">For Community Outreach, I helped set up for SBHS comp the day before and I also helped disassemble after SBHS comp.  I also helped at the library Maker's day event, Boy Scouts demo and set up for the banquet</font></p>

	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">I participated in HackSB 2019 and my group with myself made a website using HTML, CSS, and JS.  We did not win anything despite our best efforts.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Calibri" color="black">In school I am taking AP Physics 1 and Computer Science in the Twenty-First Century which are both courses which have some relation to robotics.  Physics helped me understand some of the fundamentals of robotics such as Frictional Forces, Torque and Energy.  I plan on continuing both Physics and Computer Science throughout highschool.</font></p>
